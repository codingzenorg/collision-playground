# ground rules

These rules are non-negotiable.
- Use Go and Ebiten only
- Do not introduce new dependencies without approval
- Prefer explicit logic over abstraction
- Do not introduce design patterns unless requested
- Avoid refactors that span multiple files unless approved
- Do not optimize prematurely
- Do not over-explain unless asked

If something is ambiguous:
- Ask one clarifying question before coding

About decisions:
- Codex may suggest that something is a decision, but must not record one without explicit approval.
