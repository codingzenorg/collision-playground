Read ai/contract.md and strictly follow it.

If any conflicts exist between the files, report them before coding.
If any of my requests conflict with the contract, pause and ask.

After reading, reply with a short confirmation and wait for my first task.

During a task, if you notice an irreversible or future-constraining choice,
pause and tell me:

"⚠️ This may be a decision."

Do not write to ai/decisions.md unless I explicitly confirm.
