# workflow

- Work in small, incremental steps
- One visible improvement per change
- Native execution is the reference
- WASM must also run
- The program must always remain runnable

Changes are considered done when:
- The behavior is visibly improved or extended
- The code still runs cleanly

About decisions:
- When a task results in an irreversible choice, record it in ai/decisions.md using the template in ai/templates/decision.md.

The current task, if any, is defined in task.md at the root of the current branch.
