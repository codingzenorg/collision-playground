# Workflow Expectations

- Optimize for a smooth demo: stable FPS, deterministic behavior when needed
- Keep changes incremental (one concept per commit)
- Native run is the reference; WASM must also run
- Avoid heavy refactors unless they unlock a visible improvement
- Documentation is minimal: enough to run, not to teach
