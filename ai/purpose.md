# Project Purpose

This project is part of CodingZen.

It exists to explore:
- 2D motion
- Simple physics intuition
- Visual feedback loops
- The relationship between math, code, and perception

This is not:
- A production game
- A performance benchmark
- A framework

Success means:
- The code is readable months later
- The math can be reasoned about visually
- Each concept has a clear place in the codebase

Constraints:
- Favor explicitness over abstraction
- Favor calm iteration over speed
- Favor understanding over feature count
