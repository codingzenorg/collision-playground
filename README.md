# Collision Playground

Collision Playground is a small visual laboratory for exploring motion,
boundaries, and simple physical intuition in two dimensions.

It is part of **CodingZen** — a long-term practice of building software
slowly, visibly, and with intention.

This project is not a game.
It is not a physics engine.
It is not optimized for performance.

It exists to make ideas *observable*.

Circles move.
They collide.
They reflect.
Nothing more is hidden.

The code favors clarity over cleverness.
Math is written explicitly.
Each concept has a place.

This repository is meant to be:
- Read
- Run
- Modified
- Broken
- Rebuilt

If you are here to learn, explore, or think visually, you are in the right place.

If you are here for abstraction, frameworks, or shortcuts, this may feel slow.

That is intentional.
