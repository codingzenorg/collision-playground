# Collision Playground

Collision Playground is a small visual laboratory for motion and boundaries
in two dimensions.

It is part of **CodingZen** — a practice of building calm, contained software
that exists primarily to be *seen running*.

This project is not a game.
It is not a physics engine.
It is not a tutorial.

It produces a visible system:
circles moving,
colliding,
reflecting inside a plane.

The code exists to support the behavior on screen.
Nothing more is hidden than necessary.

Videos show the system running.
They are demonstrations, not explanations.

This repository is meant to be:
- Run
- Observed
- Modified
- Re-run

If you are here to watch behavior emerge, you are in the right place.
